## üìä **Inner logic**

### **1. Honeypot Detection** üõë

Detects if a token has **honeypot** behavior, where you can buy but cannot sell (trap-like behavior).

```javascript
function detectHoneypot(txLimit, sellBlocked, liquidityMovable) {
  return (txLimit > 95 && sellBlocked && liquidityMovable);
}
```
1. txLimit ‚Üí Maximum transaction percentage (simulated contract value)

2. sellBlocked ‚Üí Indicates if the token does not allow swapExactTokensForETH

3. liquidityMovable ‚Üí If the contract allows the owner to remove LP (Liquidity Pool)

Returns: true if the token exhibits trap-like behavior (honeypot).

## 2. **LP Status Analysis üîí**
Analyzes the liquidity pool (LP) lock status, indicating the security of the token's liquidity.


```javascript
function checkLPStatus(lpLocked, lockDuration, lockSource) {
  if (!lpLocked) return "Unlocked";
  if (lockDuration > 180 && lockSource === "trusted") return "Locked";
  return "Weak Lock";
}
```
1. lpLocked ‚Üí Boolean indicating if LP is locked

2. lockDuration ‚Üí Duration in days for which the LP is locked

3. lockSource ‚Üí Source of the lock, such as DXLock, Mudra, or Unknown

Returns: "Unlocked", "Locked", or "Weak Lock" based on the liquidity pool status.

## 3. **Owner Risk Score ‚ö†Ô∏è**
Calculates a risk score for the token's owner based on the contract‚Äôs renouncement, transaction history, and token creation frequency.


```javascript
function ownerRiskScore(isRenounced, txHistory, tokenCreationFreq) {
  let score = 100;
  if (!isRenounced) score -= 40;
  if (txHistory < 10) score -= 30;
  if (tokenCreationFreq > 5) score -= 30;
  return Math.max(score, 0);
}
```
1. isRenounced ‚Üí Indicates if the contract ownership has been renounced

2. txHistory ‚Üí Number of historical transactions

3. tokenCreationFreq ‚Üí Frequency at which the deployer creates new tokens

Returns: A score between 0 and 100, with lower scores indicating higher risk.

## 4. **BuzzRate Index üêù**
Evaluates the level of activity (buzz) around a token by analyzing the number of buys, sells, unique wallets, and timeframe.

```javascript
function buzzRate(buyTxs, sellTxs, uniqueWallets, timeframeMins) {
  const txPerMin = (buyTxs + sellTxs) / timeframeMins;
  const activityFactor = uniqueWallets / 10;
  return Math.round(txPerMin * activityFactor);
}
```
1. buyTxs ‚Üí Number of buy transactions in the timeframe

2. sellTxs ‚Üí Number of sell transactions in the timeframe

3. uniqueWallets ‚Üí Number of unique wallets involved in the token's transactions

4. timeframeMins ‚Üí Timeframe in minutes over which to calculate the activity

Returns: A numeric score representing the level of activity ("low", "medium", "high", or "spike").

## 5. **Security Flags Count ‚ö†Ô∏è**
Counts the number of critical or high security flags associated with a token.

```javascript
function getSecurityFlags(contractFlags) {
  return contractFlags.filter(flag => flag.critical || flag.high).length;
}
```
contractFlags ‚Üí Array of flags, each containing risk indicators such as:
- maxTx set too low
- fee set too high
- hidden functions
- blacklist() or removeLimits()
Returns: The number of critical or high security flags for a token.

## 6.** BeeTrust Score üêù**
Calculates the overall trust score of a token based on several key factors such as honeypot risk, LP status, owner risk, and more.


```javascript
function beeTrustScore(metrics) {
  const {
    honeypotRisk, lpStatus, ownerScore, buzzRate, flags
  } = metrics;

  let score = 100;
  if (honeypotRisk) score -= 30;
  if (lpStatus === "Unlocked") score -= 20;
  if (ownerScore < 50) score -= 20;
  if (buzzRate < 3) score -= 10;
  if (flags > 2) score -= 20;

  return Math.max(score, 0);
}
```
1. honeypotRisk ‚Üí Boolean value indicating if the token is a honeypot risk
2. lpStatus ‚Üí The liquidity pool status (e.g., "Unlocked")
3. ownerScore ‚Üí The calculated risk score of the owner (from the Owner Risk Score formula)
4. buzzRate ‚Üí Activity level (from the BuzzRate Index formula)

5. flags ‚Üí The number of critical or high security flags (from the Security Flags Count formula)

Returns: A score between 0 and 100, representing the overall trustworthiness of the token.
